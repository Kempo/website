# Personal Website

The site used to be Gatsby & MDX. Sadly, only time tells whether a framework will survive.

Since Gatsby has become deprecated, the framework is Jekyll now. Everything is still deployed on Netlify.

# Production Build

```bash
bundle exec jekyll build
```

# Local Development

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve -l
```
